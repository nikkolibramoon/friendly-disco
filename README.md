# Fast Grocery Delivery Service Inventory Management

This experiment project is a fast grocery delivery service inventory management system. <br>It includes a Python script for tracking inventory accuracy at the shop level over time, along with sample data for validation.

## Features

* Inventory Accuracy Tracking:<br>Monitor inventory accuracy in each store by calculating key metrics such as Inventory Accuracy Rate (IAR), Discrepancy Rate (DR), Average Discrepancy Amount (ADA), Out-of-Stock Rate (OOSR), Stock Adjustment Frequency (SAF), and Cycle Count Accuracy (CCA).

* Sample Data Generation:<br>Create sample data with "real" data based on the provided Python script. This sample data helps validate the inventory accuracy tracking system.

## Getting Started
